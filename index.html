            <h4>A little bit about me.</h4>
                <p>I've had a few careers in my life. Most recently, for the last 13 years, I have been a barista and have managed a small buisiness coffee shope for the last 4. In that time, there have been many times that I  have said of our current software applications, "I wish it did ----", so I have jumped into the world of software development to make my wishes into reality.</p>
